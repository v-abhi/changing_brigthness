# changing_brigthness
this will change brightness level of screen from "brightness level A" to "brightness level B" automatically and smoothly.

this will let 'the brightness of screen' changes over the time constantly within some specified ranges.


Idea
  inspired by nature; In whole day, brightness level of surrounding changes from low(in morning) to high(in afternoon) and
  again to low(in eveing).
  
  In the same way, brightness of our screen will change continuosly.
  
  This can be also thought as an exercise of eyes to maintain its flexibility.
  we will not have to stare on same brightness level without changing b-level manually.
